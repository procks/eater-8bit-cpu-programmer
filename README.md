# eater-8bit-cpu-programmer
Programmer for Ben Eater 8-bit computer

The programmer has 4 sample programs that can be selected with a button. It also allows programming via a serial terminal.

For programming, all DIP switches must be set to the **up position** and the CPU must be in programming mode. Then press the left button.

Pre-programmed samples:
- Fibonacci
- Double
- FizzBuzz prints each number 1 to 255, printing 0 if the number is divisible by 3 and printing 255 if the number is divisible by 5 (required [additional instructions](https://github.com/procks/beneater-8bit-eeprom/tree/main/microcode-eeprom-programmer))
- Counts up to 255 and then counts down to 0
